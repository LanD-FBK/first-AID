# first-AID

<p>
First-AID is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) data collection framework for knowledge-driven generation of synthetic dialogues using LLM prompting. In particular, our framework implements different strategies of data collection that require different user intervention during dialogue generation to reduce post-editing efforts and enhance the quality of generated dialogues. Find more details in our ACL 2025 paper: *[First-AID: the first Annotation Interface for grounded Dialogues](/https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-demo.54/) (Menini et al., ACL 2025)*. If you use the First-AID please <a href="https://github.com/LanD-FBK/first-AID/tree/main#bibtex-citation">cite</a> our original paper.
